Why i chose Debian for my VM:
		- I chose debian because it is easier to use and better to configure for personal use over rocky.

Difference between Debian and Rocky:
	Debian:
		- It supports multiple architectures compared to other distros.
		- It is easier to update from one stable to a new version.
		- It uses apt / aptitude as its package manager.
		- It uses AppArmor as its shipped security module.
		- It has a slower release cycle of 2 years.
	Rocky:
		- It is best to install a fresh version of rocky when an update is released.
		- It uses yum as its package manager.
		- It uses SELinux as its shipped security module.
		- It has a faster release cycle of 6 months.
		- It doesn't as much architecture support.
		
AppArmor:
		- AppArmor is a mandatory access control security module.
		- It is shipped with debian.
		- Its purpose is to prevent harm to the OS from internal or external programs.
  
What is SSH (Secure Shell):
		- SSH is a protocol that provides secure communication over untrusted networks.
		- Allows users to access remote machines securely, execute commands, and transfer files.
		- It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in network communications.
  
What is UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):
		- UFW is a user-friendly command-line interface for configuring iptables.
		- It provides a simplified way to manage firewall rules on Linux systems.
		- It enhances security by controlling network traffic.
  
What is LVM (Logical Volume Manager):
		- LVM allows for very flexible disk space management.
		- It provides the ability to add disk space to a logical volume and its filesystem while that file system is mounted and active.
		- It allows for multiple physical drives to be grouped into one volume on the system.
  
What is a VM (Virtual Machine):
		- Virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to coexist on a single physical machine.
		- It provides isolation, resource efficiency, and flexibility for various purposes such as development, testing, and server consolidation.
  
What is Cron:
		- Cron is a tool that schedules and automates regular tasks on Unix-like systems.
		- It makes it easy to perform routine actions at set times.

What is Sudo:
		- Sudo or superuser do is a command line tool that allows user level accounts to use commands with superuser level permissions when given permission by a high user.

Commands:
	ufw:
		- sudo ufw status / verbose  [Shows the status of UFW]
	user management:
		- getent group GROUP_NAME [Get people in the given group]
		- sudo useradd USER_NAME [Adds a new user to the system]
		- sudo groupadd GROUP_NAME [Adds a new group to the system]
		- sudo usermod -aG GROUP_NAME USER_NAME [Appends a given group to a given users list of groups]
	system:
		- hostnamectl [Shows the hostname information]
		- sudo hostnamectl set-hostname [Sets the hostname of the system]
		- sudo reboot [Reboots the system]
		- lsblk [Shows the tree of the systems partitions]

		- sudo crontab -u root -e 
		- sudo cronstop
		- sudo cronstart
